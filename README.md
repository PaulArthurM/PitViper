> **An analysis pipeline to analyze functional screening data from shRNA, CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/dCas9 experiments.**

## Introduction

PitViper is intended to facilitate the analysis of functional screening data from various experiments (shRNA, CRISPR/Cas9 or CRISPR/dCas9).

The pipeline is built with [`Snakemake`](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a workflow management system to create reproducible and scalable data analyses.
